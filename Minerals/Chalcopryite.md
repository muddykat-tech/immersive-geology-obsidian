Primary Source for [[Copper]]
Secondary Source for [[Iron]]

[[Slag]] Can be pulverised into [[Powdered Slag]], Which can then be dissolved in [[Sulfuric Acid]] in the [[Chemical Reactor]] to produce [[Cloudy Mineral Slurry]] which is then processed in the [[Centrifuge]] to create [[Clear Mineral Slurry]] and a Platinum Group Metal [[Residue]] 

This [[Clear Mineral Slurry]] can then be processed in the [[Crystallizer]] to create [[Copper]] [[Crystal]] and [[Iron Sulfate]] Which can then be processed again in the [[Crystallizer]] to create [[Iron]] [[Crystal]] and [[Sulfuric Acid]] 

The PGM can then be processed further in the [[Chemical Reactor]] with [[Sodium Hydroxide]] to create [[Sodium Osmate]] and [[Platinum]] [[Compound Dust]] 

[[Platinum]] [[Compound Dust]] in the [[Chemical Reactor]] with [[Nitric Acid]] and [[Hydrochloric Acid]] to create [[Platinum]] [[Aqua Regia Solution]] we then react this in the [[Chemical Reactor]] with [[Sodium]] [[Compound Dust]] to create [[Platinum]] [[Powder]] and [[Chemical Waste]]

[[Sodium Osmate]] is then Processed in the [[Chemical Reactor]] with [[Hydrochloric Acid]] and [[Nitric Acid]] to create [[Osmium]] [[Powder]]
